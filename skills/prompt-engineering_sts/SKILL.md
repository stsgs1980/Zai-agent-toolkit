# Skill: Prompt Engineering v1.1

> ID: ZAI-STS-001
> Version: 1.1
> Last Updated: 2026-05

Expert prompt engineering with scoring, techniques, and frameworks.

---

## 1. Prompt Scoring (6 Dimensions)

[C] Always score before improving. Scoring is your diagnostic tool -- without it you are guessing.

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Specificity | 0.25 | How specific and unambiguous the request is |
| Clarity | 0.20 | Ease of understanding, action verbs, structure |
| Context | 0.15 | Sufficient background, role, audience, domain |
| Completeness | 0.15 | All necessary info: input/output, edge cases, criteria |
| Constraint Control | 0.15 | Effective output constraining, negative constraints, limits |
| Actionability | 0.10 | Leads to implementable, verifiable response |

**Grading:** S (95+) > A (80+) > B (65+) > C (50+) > D (35+) > F (<35)

When scoring, show: overall grade + numeric score, each dimension with grade and feedback, top 3 weakest dimensions with specific improvement suggestions.

---

## 2. Prompt Improvement Workflow

1. **Score** the current prompt (baseline + diagnosis)
2. **Identify** the weakest 2-3 dimensions (targets)
3. **Select** the most relevant technique(s) from Section 4
4. **Apply** one technique at a time, rewrite the prompt
5. **Re-score** to verify improvement (show before/after)
6. **Explain** what changed and why it matters
7. **Stop** when score reaches B+ (70+) or after 3 iterations, whichever comes first

[C] Never apply more than 2 techniques in a single improvement iteration. Stacking too many makes the prompt unreadable.

[W] Stop improving when the score reaches A-grade (80+). Further gains are marginal and the prompt is production-ready.

**Done criteria** -- improvement is complete when:
- Overall score is B+ (70+) or higher
- No dimension scores below C (50)
- The user confirms the output matches their intent

If after 3 iterations the score is still below B+, explain the structural limitations and suggest a different framework.

---

## 3. Framework Selection

| Framework | Best For | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| **RTF** (Role-Task-Format) | Code gen, content writing, data extraction -- 80% of needs | Simple |
| **RISE** (Role-Input-Steps-Expectation) | Data processing, reports, code review | Simple |
| **CARE** (Context-Action-Result-Example) | Data transformation, format conversion | Simple |
| **STONE** (Setup-Task-Objective-Notes-Extras) | Quick questions, debugging, brainstorming | Simple |
| **CREATE** (Context-Request-Explanation-Action-Tone-Extras) | Blog posts, marketing, emails | Moderate |
| **TRACE** (Task-Request-Action-Context-Example) | Complex code gen, system design | Moderate |
| **SCOPE** (Specific-Context-Objective-Persona-Execution) | API dev, DB schemas, infrastructure | Moderate |
| **PACKED** (Purpose-Audience-Context-Key-Emotion-Detail) | Notifications, release notes, onboarding | Moderate |
| **CO-STAR** (Context-Objective-Style-Tone-Audience-Response) | Policy docs, guidelines, formal communication | Moderate |
| **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | Doc search, knowledge Q&A, legal/compliance | Complex |
| **CHAIN** (Multi-Agent Chain) | Code pipelines, content workflows, CI/CD | Complex |

[C] Start with RTF. Upgrade to TRACE/SCOPE only if more structure is needed. CREATE/PACKED for creative content. CHAIN for multi-step pipelines.

[C] Never recommend the 5-layer system prompt architect for tasks solvable with RTF. If a simple Role-Task-Format prompt gets the job done (80% of cases), do not over-engineer.

## 4. Technique Selection + Examples

### Prompt is too vague

**Explicit Instruction** -- add specificity first. Replace vague words with concrete requirements.

> Before: "Write a summary of this article."
> After: "Write a 3-paragraph summary of this article. Paragraph 1: main argument. Paragraph 2: supporting evidence. Paragraph 3: implications for software teams. Maximum 200 words total."

**Precision Drill** -- replace every vague term with a measurable one.

> Before: "Make the response faster."
> After: "Reduce API response time from 800ms to under 200ms at the 95th percentile."

**Definition Lock** -- lock key term definitions before reasoning starts.

> Before: "Analyze the security of this system."
> After: "Analyze the security of this system. By 'security' I mean: resistance to SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and unauthorized access to admin endpoints. Do not evaluate availability or performance."

### Need better reasoning

**Chain of Thought** -- step-by-step reasoning for math/logic/multi-step tasks.

> Before: "What is 15% of 340?"
> After: "What is 15% of 340? Think step by step: 1) Convert 15% to decimal, 2) Multiply by 340, 3) State the final answer."

**Plan and Solve** -- plan first, then execute. Prevents jumping to wrong solutions.

> Before: "Refactor this function."
> After: "Refactor this function. First, identify the 3 code smells. Then, for each smell, describe the refactoring technique you will apply. Finally, show the refactored code with comments marking each change."

### Need to control output

**Structured Output** -- specify exact format.

> Before: "List the errors in this code."
> After: "List the errors in this code as a JSON array. Each entry must have: `severity` (critical|high|medium|low), `line` (number), `type` (syntax|logic|security|performance), `fix` (one-sentence suggestion)."

**Negative Constraint** -- list what NOT to include.

> Before: "Review this pull request."
> After: "Review this pull request. Do NOT comment on: code style, formatting, naming conventions, or import ordering. Focus ONLY on logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and performance regressions."

### Need domain expertise

**Role Assignment** -- frame the AI as a domain expert.

> Before: "Is this API design good?"
> After: "You are a principal API architect with 15 years of experience designing RESTful systems at scale. Evaluate this API design against industry best practices (OpenAPI 3.0, REST constraints, backward compatibility)."

**Few-Shot Learning** -- provide examples of desired input/output.

> Before: "Generate a commit message for my changes."
> After: "Generate a commit message for my changes. Examples of good commit messages:
> - `feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation`
> - `fix(api): handle null response from payment gateway`
> - `refactor(db): extract connection pooling into shared module`"

### Need structure

**Delimiter Pattern** -- separate instructions from data with markers.

> Before: "Translate this text to French: Hello world"
> After: "Translate the text between <input> tags to French.
> <input>
> Hello world
> </input>"

## 5. System Prompt Architecture (5 Layers)

For AI agents and chatbots, use the 5-layer architect:

| Layer | Weight | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | 0.9 | Yes | Role, domain, tone, language, audience |
| **Context** | 0.7 | Yes | Environment, domain knowledge, tools |
| **Constraints** | 1.0 | Yes | Numbered hard rules, forbidden actions |
| **Output** | 0.95 | Yes | Format-specific instructions |
| **Behavior** | 0.6 | No | Tone mapping, quality standards, edge cases |

[I] Simple tasks: Identity + Output (2 layers). Production agents: all 5 layers.

When building: start with Identity, add Context, set Constraints (number them, use NEVER), specify Output format exactly, optionally add Behavior with tone mapping and edge case handling.

---

## 6. Intent Detection

| Intent | Signals | Best Framework | Best Technique |
|---|---|---|---|
| Code generation | "write code", "implement", "build" | RTF or TRACE | Structured Output |
| Code review | "review", "analyze code", "refactor" | RISE | Adversarial Reviewer |
| Debugging | "bug", "error", "fix", "crash" | STONE | Chain of Thought |
| Explanation | "explain", "what is", "how does" | RTF | Few-Shot |
| Data analysis | "analyze", "statistics", "metrics" | SCOPE | Structured Output |
| Creative writing | "write", "story", "article", "copy" | CREATE or PACKED | Role Assignment |
| Layout/UI | "layout", "grid", "dashboard" | SCOPE | Few-Shot |
| Translation | "translate", "convert to", "localize" | CARE | Delimiter Pattern |
| Refactoring | "refactor", "restructure", "simplify" | TRACE | Plan and Solve |
| Testing | "test", "spec", "unit test", "coverage" | RTF | Few-Shot |

[W] If unsure which technique to pick, default to Explicit Instruction -- it is the safest starting point.

---

## 7. Decision Tree

```text
User request
  |
  +-- "Improve my prompt" -> Score (Section 1) -> Identify weak dimensions -> Apply technique (Section 4) -> Re-score
  |
  +-- "Build a system prompt" -> Simple task? -> Yes -> RTF + 2 layers (Identity + Output)
  |                                       -> No  -> 5-layer architect (Section 5)
  |
  +-- "Compare prompts" -> Score both -> Side-by-side table with deltas -> Declare winner
  |
  +-- "Which technique/framework?" -> Detect intent (Section 6) -> Match framework (Section 3) + technique (Section 4)
  |
  +-- "Design multi-agent system" -> Choose pattern (Section 8) -> Define agent roles -> Map data flow
  |
  +-- "Think through a decision" -> Select cognitive formula (Section 9) -> Apply step by step
```

---

## 8. Multi-Agent Orchestration

| Pattern | Topology | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Sequential Chain | sequential | Plan -> Code -> Review |
| Parallel Experts | parallel | Multi-perspective review |
| Hierarchical Delegate | hierarchical | Manager -> specialists -> integrate |
| Debate Adversarial | mesh | Architecture decisions |
| Iterative Refinement | sequential | Generate -> Criticize -> Refine |
| Ensemble Voting | parallel | Answer validation |
| Diamond | hierarchical | Diverge-then-converge |
| Supervisor-Workers | hierarchical | Batch processing at scale |

---

## 9. Cognitive Formulas

Use these when the user needs to think through a problem, not when they just need a better prompt.

**Bias Mitigation:** Anchoring Break (3 approaches before choosing), Confirmation Discount (argue FOR + AGAINST), Status Quo Challenge (when are assumptions FALSE?)

**Reasoning:** First Principles (strip to fundamentals), Inversion ("How would I guarantee failure?"), Pre-Mortem ("It failed. Why?")

**Creativity:** Constraint-Driven Creativity (add artificial constraints), SCAMPER (7 transformations), Random Input (map unrelated concept)

**Precision:** Precision Drill (replace vague with measurable), Boundary Check (KNOW / SUSPECT / DO NOT KNOW / NEED MORE INFO)

**Perspective:** Stakeholder Map (N viewpoints), Time Machine (now / 6mo / 2yr / 5yr)

**Self-Critique:** Self-Audit (accuracy/completeness/clarity/relevance/consistency), Devil's Advocate (case FOR, then AGAINST, then verdict)

---

## Hard Constraints

[C] These 5 rules are non-negotiable. Violating any is a critical failure.

1. **NEVER assign grade S (95+) if two or more dimensions score below B (65).** S-tier means excellence across the board, not just high average.
2. **NEVER recommend the 5-layer system prompt architect for tasks solvable with RTF.** If a simple Role-Task-Format prompt gets the job done (80% of cases), do not over-engineer.
3. **NEVER use Chain of Thought for formatting tasks.** CoT is for reasoning (math, logic, multi-step analysis). Using it for "format this as JSON" wastes tokens and confuses the model.
4. **NEVER apply more than 2 techniques in a single improvement iteration.** Stack too many techniques and the prompt becomes unreadable.
5. **NEVER replace the user's prompt entirely.** Improve it, don't rewrite from scratch. Keep their voice, intent, and domain-specific terminology intact.

---

## Error Handling

| Problem | What to Do |
|---|---|
| Score stays flat after 2 iterations | The technique doesn't fit the problem. Switch to a different category. |
| User says "this isn't what I meant" | Stop. Ask the user to clarify their intent. |
| Improved prompt scores higher but user dislikes it | You optimized for the framework, not the user. Revert and adjust. |
| Two dimensions conflict | Prioritize based on the user's stated goal. |
| Prompt is already A-grade (80+) | Stop improving. Explain that further gains are marginal. |
| Unsure which technique to pick | Use the intent detection table (Section 6). Default to Explicit Instruction. |

## Communication Style

- No emoji or Unicode graphics in responses
- Use text tags for status: [OK], [FAIL], [TODO], [WARNING]
- Use severity tags for rules: [C] (Critical), [W] (Warning), [I] (Info)
- Use ASCII diagrams for flows: ->, |, +, v, ^
