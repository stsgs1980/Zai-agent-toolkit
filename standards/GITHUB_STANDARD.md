## 1. Commit Format

### 1.1 Conventional Commits (Required)

All commit messages MUST follow [Conventional Commits v1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### 1.2 Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(button): add size="lg" variant` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(tabs): correct aria-selected on rerender` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change | `refactor(tokens): move contrast utils to separate file` |
| `docs` | Documentation only | `docs(standards): add WCAG 2.1 AA compliance` |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, no logic change | `style(card): fix indentation` |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | `test(button): add keyboard navigation tests` |
| `chore` | Build, tooling, CI, dependencies | `chore(deps): update react to 19.1` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | `perf(grid): memoize layout calculations` |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration | `ci: add accessibility audit step` |
| `build` | Build system changes | `build(tsup): add minification` |

### 1.3 Scopes

Scope = layer or package affected:

```
tokens, ui, sections, features, hooks, providers, cli, eslint-plugin,
browser, create-app, theme, layout, a11y, docs, standards
```

### 1.4 Rules

- Description in **imperative mood**: "add feature" NOT "added feature"
- Description in **English** always (per Language Rule)
- No period at end
- Lowercase first letter
- Max 72 characters in first line
- Body: explain WHY, not WHAT (diff shows WHAT)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Good
feat(sections): add hero-section with 3 variants
fix(theme): correct contrast ratio for muted-foreground on Zinc
refactor(docs): consolidate standards into docs/standards/

# Bad
update stuff
fixed bug
Added new component
feat: add feature.  # no period
feat(ui): This component does X and Y and Z...  # too long
```

---

## 2. Branch Naming

### 2.1 Format

```
<type>/<ticket>-<short-description>
```

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New feature | `feat/wcag-contrast-audit` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/tabs-keyboard-nav` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring | `refactor/docs-consolidation` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `docs/github-standard` |
| `chore/` | Tooling, CI | `chore/update-deps` |
| `release/` | Release preparation | `release/v1.2.0` |

### 2.2 Rules

- Lowercase, hyphens only (no underscores, no camelCase)
- Max 50 characters
- Short description: 2-4 words
- No ticket number = use descriptive name

---

## 3. Forbidden Operations

### 3.1 CRITICAL: Never Do This

| Operation | Why Forbidden | Alternative |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `git pull --rebase` | Blocks Z.ai sandbox on conflict | `git push --force-with-lease` |
| `git push --force` | Overwrites remote without safety | `git push --force-with-lease` |
| `git pull` after remote URL change | Creates unnecessary conflicts | `git push --force-with-lease` |
| `git reset --hard` without backup | Data loss | Backup first (see Section 4) |
| Direct push to `main` for experiments | No review, no rollback | Use branch + PR/merge |
| Commit secrets/tokens | Security breach | Use `.env.example` + `.gitignore` |
| `git add .` for partial changes | Stages unrelated files | `git add -p` or explicit paths |
| Amend published commits | Rewrites shared history | New commit instead |

### 3.2 WARNING: Avoid Without Good Reason

| Operation | Risk | When OK |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `git merge` (vs rebase) | Messy history | Release branches only |
| `git rebase -i` on shared branch | Rewrites others' commits | Only on your own branch |
| `git cherry-pick` | Duplicate commits | Hotfixes only |
| Force push to feature branch | Team disruption | Solo work only |

---

## 4. Backup Before Rewrite

Before ANY operation that rewrites history (rebase, merge, pull, reset --hard):

```bash
# Step 1: Stash uncommitted work
git stash push -m "pre-op-backup"

# Step 2: Copy packages (most valuable code)
cp -r packages/ /tmp/stsgs-backup/

# Step 3: Save git log reference
git log --oneline -20 > /tmp/git-log-backup.txt
```

### 4.1 Recovery from Git Lockup

If a previous session left git in blocked state:

```bash
rm -rf .git/rebase-merge .git/rebase-apply
git reset --hard HEAD
```

### 4.2 No Panic Diagnostics

Before telling user data is lost, check ALL 5 paths:

1. `ls packages/ui/src/` — do files exist?
2. `ls .git/rebase-merge/` — is rebase paused?
3. `git reflog` — are commits referenced?
4. `ls /tmp/stsgs-backup-*/` — were backups created?
5. `git fsck --lost-found` — dangling objects?

NEVER say "permanently lost" until all 5 checks are exhausted.

---

## 5. Push Policy

### 5.1 Push Frequency

Push after every significant change. Do not accumulate half-finished work locally.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Feature or fix completed | Push immediately |
| End of work session | Push even if unfinished |
| CI red | Push OK, fix soon |
| Experimental branch | Push immediately, do not merge without review |
| Token expired | Update token, update remote URL, push |

**Minimum:** 1 push at end of every session.

**Formula:**

```
work -> commit -> push -> peace of mind
```

### 5.2 Checkpoint System

Do NOT wait until session end. Create checkpoints during work systematically.

| Checkpoint Type | When | Commit Format |
|-----------------|------|---------------|
| **WIP** | Every 15-20 min during active work | `chore(wip): checkpoint -- <task-id> in progress` |
| **Milestone** | Logical unit completed | `feat(ui): add button component` |
| **Pre-risk** | Before risky operation (refactor, delete) | `chore: checkpoint before <operation>` |
| **Session End** | End of session | `chore: session checkpoint` |

**WIP Checkpoint Rules:**

- Even incomplete work gets committed
- Prefix with `chore(wip):` to signal "work in progress"
- Push immediately after commit
- Log to worklog.md

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# After 15-20 min of work
git add -A
git commit -m "chore(wip): checkpoint -- task 2-a in progress"
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Continue working...
```

### 5.3 Recovery Tags

Before operations that might need rollback:

```bash
# Create recovery point
git tag checkpoint-<task-id>-before-<operation>
git push origin checkpoint-<task-id>-before-<operation>

# Example
git tag checkpoint-2a-before-refactor
git push origin checkpoint-2a-before-refactor

# Perform risky operation...

# If something goes wrong, rollback
git reset --hard checkpoint-2a-before-refactor
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Tag naming convention:**

```
checkpoint-<task-id>-before-<operation>
checkpoint-<task-id>-after-<operation>  (optional, for verification)
```

### 5.4 Force Push Rules

| Command | Status | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `git push --force-with-lease origin main` | CORRECT | Safe force push with remote check |
| `git push --force origin main` | AVOID | No safety check, overwrites silently |
| `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>` | OK | Feature branch force push after rebase |

---

## 6. Versioning and Tags

### 6.1 Semantic Versioning

All releases MUST follow [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

| Change | Bump | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Breaking API change | MAJOR | 1.x.x -> 2.0.0 |
| New feature (backward compatible) | MINOR | 1.2.x -> 1.3.0 |
| Bug fix (backward compatible) | PATCH | 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 |

### 6.2 Tagging

```bash
# Annotated tag (required)
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "feat: add hero-section with 3 variants"

# Push tag
git push origin v1.2.0
```

Rules:
- Tags MUST be annotated (`-a`), not lightweight
- Tag format: `v` + semver (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
- No pre-release tags without team agreement

### 6.3 Changelog

Every release MUST update `CHANGELOG.md` with:

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- hero-section with 3 variants

### Fixed
- Contrast ratio for muted-foreground on Zinc theme

### Changed
- Consolidated docs into docs/ directory
```

---

## 7. Branch Protection

### 7.1 Main Branch

- No direct pushes (use PR or merge from feature branch)
- CI must pass before merge
- At least 1 review required (when team grows)
- Squash merge preferred (clean history)

### 7.2 Feature Branches

- Auto-delete after merge
- Prefix with type (feat/, fix/, refactor/)
- One feature per branch — no mixed changes

### 7.3 Release Branches

- `release/vX.Y.Z` for release preparation
- Only bug fixes and docs on release branches
- Merge back to main after release

---

## 8. .gitignore Requirements

These MUST be in `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Secrets
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Build
dist/
.next/
.turbo/

# Database
*.db
*.db-journal

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
dev.log

# Uploads (user content, not code)
upload/
```

### 8.1 Required in Repository

These MUST be committed:

```text
.env.example        # Safe defaults, no real secrets
.eslintrc.*         # Linting configuration

## 10. Sandbox Z.ai Git Rules

The Z.ai sandbox has specific constraints:

- **Shared filesystem**: All chat sessions share the same filesystem
- **Process mortality**: Background processes die when chat ends
- **No cross-chat process sharing**: Cannot control processes from other chats
- **Local changes = data loss risk**: Always push before session ends

### 10.1 Session Start Checklist

```bash
# Check if git is in a blocked state
ls .git/rebase-merge/ 2>/dev/null && echo "REBASE BLOCKED"
git status

# If blocked, recover
rm -rf .git/rebase-merge .git/rebase-apply
git reset --hard HEAD
```

### 10.2 Session End Checklist

```bash
# Commit everything
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: session checkpoint"

# Push always
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### 10.3 Deadlock Problem

Sandbox performs automatic `git pull` / `git merge` on session restart. If local repository state diverges from remote (unpushed commits, uncommitted files, dirty working tree) — a merge conflict occurs.

Merge conflict blocks `git status` (exit code != 0). Infrastructure uses `git status` as pre-check before executing ANY tool (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, etc.). Result: **complete deadlock** — no tool can execute, including tools to fix the conflict itself.

**Vicious cycle:**
```
git status -> merge conflict -> exit code != 0
-> tool pre-check fails -> tool blocked
-> cannot fix merge -> git status still fails
-> DEADLOCK
```

### 10.4 Mandatory Rules to Prevent Deadlock

#### Rule 1: Push After Every Stage

Each completed stage of work = commit + push. No exceptions.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "stage: description"
git push origin main
```

**Forbidden:**
- Accumulating multiple stages in one commit
- Making commit without subsequent push
- Leaving uncommitted files when moving to next task

#### Rule 2: Checklist Before Session End

Before session closes / breaks / restarts:

```bash
# 1. All changes committed?
git status
# Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

# 2. All commits pushed?
git log --oneline -5
# Compare with remote:
git log origin/main..HEAD
# Expected: empty (no unpushed commits)

# 3. Final push
git push origin main

# 4. Re-check
git status
# Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
```

#### Rule 3: Dirty Working Tree = No Stop

If `git status` shows uncommitted changes — session MUST NOT interrupt without prior commit + push. If session breaks unexpectedly — first command on next start: `git status` to check.

#### Rule 4: One Task = One Commit + Push

```
Task -> code -> test -> git add -> git commit -> git push -> next task
```

Not "10 tasks -> 1 commit -> push", but "1 task -> 1 commit -> 1 push".

### 10.5 Deadlock Recovery Procedure

If deadlock already occurred (all tools blocked):

**Level 1 - Manual Terminal (if available):**
```bash
rm -f .git/MERGE_HEAD .git/MERGE_MSG .git/MERGE_MODE
git reset --hard HEAD
git status  # check if clean
git push origin main --force  # if needed to sync with remote
```

**Level 2 - Sandbox Restart:**
- All code is on GitHub (if push rules were followed)
- Sandbox will clone fresh repository on clean start
- Merge conflict won't occur since starting state = remote

**Level 3 - Nuclear Reset (if Level 1 and 2 don't help):**
```bash
mv .git .git.broken
git init
git remote add origin <remote-url>
git fetch origin
git reset origin/main
```

### 10.6 Signs of Standard Violation

| Sign | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `git status` != clean before restart | Deadlock risk | Immediate commit + push |
| `git log origin/main..HEAD` != empty | Unpushed commits | Immediate push |
| Commits without push at session end | Conflict on restart | Push before ending |
| `git status` shows "needs merge" | Deadlock already started | Recovery procedure |

### 10.7 Integration with Other Standards

- **STD-FE-001** (Anti-Monolith): after file refactoring -> commit + push
- **Worklog**: after updating worklog.md -> commit + push
- **New skill/documentation**: after creation -> commit + push

**Principle:** any action changing filesystem must end with commit + push before moving to next action.

### 10.8 AI Agent Checklist (mandatory before each stage)

```
[ ] Code written/changed
[ ] git add -A
[ ] git commit -m "description"
[ ] git push origin main
[ ] git status -> clean
[ ] Logged to worklog.md
[ ] git add worklog.md && git commit && git push (if worklog updated)
```

### 10.9 Network Failure Recovery

Network interruptions during git operations can leave the repository in a locked or inconsistent state. This section describes how to recover safely.

#### 10.9.1 Signs of Network Failure During Git Operation

| Sign | Meaning | Detection |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Command hangs > 30 seconds | Network timeout | No output, process stuck |
| `fatal: unable to access` | Connection lost | Error message with URL |
| `Connection timed out` | Server unreachable | Error message |
| `index.lock` exists | Interrupted operation | `ls .git/index.lock` |
| `Could not resolve host` | DNS failure | Error message |

#### 10.9.2 Safe Interruption of Hung Git Operations

If a git command hangs (no response for 30+ seconds):

```bash
# Step 1: Do NOT force-kill the process immediately
# Wait 10-15 seconds more, it might recover

# Step 2: If still stuck, find the process
ps aux | grep git

# Step 3: Graceful termination first
kill <pid>  # SIGTERM

# Step 4: Wait 5 seconds
sleep 5

# Step 5: Force kill only if still running
kill -9 <pid>  # SIGKILL (last resort)
```

**CRITICAL:** Never use `kill -9` as first action — it leaves `.lock` files.

#### 10.9.3 Removing Git Lock Files

After interrupting a git operation, lock files may remain:

```bash
# Check for lock files
ls -la .git/*.lock 2>/dev/null
ls -la .git/objects/*.lock 2>/dev/null
ls -la .git/refs/*.lock 2>/dev/null

# Remove index lock (safe if no other git process running)
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Remove object locks
rm -f .git/objects/*.lock

# Remove ref locks
rm -f .git/refs/**/*.lock

# Verify no git processes running
ps aux | grep git
```

**Rule:** Only remove `.lock` files when NO other git process is running.

#### 10.9.4 Repository Integrity Check After Failure

After network recovery, verify repository integrity:

```bash
# Step 1: Check repository integrity
git fsck --full

# Expected output:
# "dangling commit" or "dangling blob" = OK (orphaned objects)
# "missing blob" or "corrupt" = PROBLEM (requires repair)

# Step 2: Check if HEAD is valid
git rev-parse HEAD

# Step 3: Verify working tree
git status

# Step 4: If status shows errors, re-read index
git read-tree HEAD

# Step 5: Hard reset if needed (WARNING: loses uncommitted changes)
git reset --hard HEAD
```

#### 10.9.5 Recovery Scenarios

**Scenario A: Push interrupted mid-transfer**

```bash
# 1. Check what was pushed
git log origin/main..HEAD

# 2. Remove any partial upload locks
rm -f .git/objects/pack/*.lock

# 3. Retry push
git push origin main

# If push fails with "non-fast-forward":
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Scenario B: Fetch/Pull interrupted**

```bash
# 1. Remove fetch locks
rm -f .git/FETCH_HEAD
rm -f .git/objects/pack/*.lock

# 2. Re-fetch
git fetch origin

# 3. Then merge/rebase as needed
git merge origin/main
# OR
git rebase origin/main
```

**Scenario C: Clone interrupted**

```bash
# If clone was interrupted, delete partial clone and restart
cd ..
rm -rf <repo-name>
git clone <url>
```

**Scenario D: Merge interrupted by network (during pull)**

```bash
# 1. Check merge state
ls .git/MERGE_HEAD

# 2. If exists and you want to abort:
rm -f .git/MERGE_HEAD .git/MERGE_MSG .git/MERGE_MODE
git reset --hard HEAD

# 3. If you want to continue:
git merge --continue
```

#### 10.9.6 Git Timeout Configuration

Configure git to fail faster on network issues instead of hanging indefinitely:

```bash
# Set timeout for git operations (seconds)
git config --global http.lowSpeedLimit 1000
git config --global http.lowSpeedTime 10

# Connection timeout (seconds)
# Note: git uses curl, so this helps:
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000

# For SSH connections, add to ~/.ssh/config:
# Host github.com
#     ConnectTimeout 10
#     ServerAliveInterval 5
#     ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

#### 10.9.7 Offline Work Protocol

When you know internet is unstable or unavailable:

```bash
# Before going offline:
git fetch --all
git status  # ensure clean

# Work offline (commits are local)
git add -A
git commit -m "work offline checkpoint"

# When back online:
git push origin main
```

**Critical:** Never end session with uncommitted work + no internet. Wait for connection or document the risk.

#### 10.9.8 Network Failure Prevention Checklist

```
[ ] Git timeouts configured
[ ] No `.lock` files present before starting work
[ ] Clean working tree (git status) before network operations
[ ] SSH config has timeouts set
[ ] Working on feature branch (not main) for risky operations
[ ] Recovery tag created before large operations
```

### 10.10 Sandbox Git Safety Rules

This section covers additional safety rules specific to Z.ai sandbox environment, addressing the middleware hook mechanism and other sandbox-specific risks.

#### 10.10.1 Middleware Hook Deadlock Mechanism

Z.ai sandbox infrastructure uses a **pre-command hook** that intercepts ALL shell commands. This hook:

1. Runs `git status` before executing ANY command
2. If `git status` returns non-zero (merge conflict, rebase in progress, dirty state) — **command is BLOCKED**
3. Blocking applies to ALL tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, etc.
4. Even `echo`, `ls`, `rm` are blocked when git is in conflict state

**This creates absolute deadlock:**
```
git conflict -> middleware blocks all commands
-> cannot run recovery commands
-> cannot fix conflict
-> DEADLOCK
```

**Recovery from middleware deadlock is ONLY possible via:**
- Session restart (if code was pushed to remote)
- Manual intervention by platform administrators
- Using a bypass terminal (if available in UI)

#### 10.10.2 Absolute Prohibitions for Z.ai Sandbox

These operations are **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** in Z.ai sandbox:

| Operation | Why | Consequence |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| `git pull --rebase` | Creates rebase conflict | Middleware deadlock |
| `git pull` (without prior fetch) | Unexpected merge conflict | Middleware deadlock |
| `git rebase` on dirty tree | Cannot abort, conflict stuck | Middleware deadlock |
| `git stash` with conflict markers | Stash apply fails | Potential deadlock |
| `git merge` without commit | Leaves merge state | Middleware deadlock |
| Long-running rebase | Session timeout = stuck rebase | Middleware deadlock |
| Editing files during rebase/merge | Conflict resolution required | Extended deadlock risk |

**When in doubt, the safe path is ALWAYS:**
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

#### 10.10.3 Pre-Command Checklist (MUST run before any git operation)

Before executing ANY git operation, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check current state
git status
# Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean" OR known changes

# 2. Check for lock files
ls .git/*.lock 2>/dev/null && echo "LOCK EXISTS - remove first"
ls .git/rebase-merge/ 2>/dev/null && echo "REBASE IN PROGRESS - abort first"

# 3. Check remote state
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
# If output NOT empty: remote is ahead

# 4. Check for uncommitted work
git diff --stat
# If output NOT empty: working tree dirty
```

**Decision matrix:**

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Clean tree, remote up-to-date | Safe to proceed |
| Dirty tree, no remote changes | Commit + push, then proceed |
| Remote ahead, clean tree | `git push --force-with-lease` (your project) |
| Remote ahead, dirty tree | Commit + `git push --force-with-lease` |
| Lock files exist | Remove locks, verify clean, then proceed |
| Rebase/merge in progress | ABORT first: `git rebase --abort` or `git merge --abort` |

#### 10.10.4 Remote Ahead Decision Tree

When `git log HEAD..origin/main` shows remote has commits:

```
REMOTE AHEAD?
    |
    v
Is this YOUR project (solo work)?
    |
    +-- YES --> git push --force-with-lease origin main
    |           (your local state is authoritative)
    |
    +-- NO --> Is remote change important?
                |
                +-- YES --> git fetch origin
                |           git log origin/main
                |           # Review changes
                |           git reset --hard origin/main
                |           # Then reapply your work
                |
                +-- NO --> git push --force-with-lease origin main
                           (your work overrides)
```

#### 10.10.5 Rebase Deadlock Recovery

If rebase deadlock occurred (middleware blocked all commands):

**You CANNOT recover without session restart.**

Before restart, remember:
- All local uncommitted work WILL be lost
- Unpushed commits MAY be lost

**After restart (fresh session):**
```bash
# 1. Check state
ls .git/rebase-merge/ 2>/dev/null && echo "REBASE STILL EXISTS"

# 2. Abort rebase immediately
git rebase --abort 2>/dev/null || rm -rf .git/rebase-merge .git/rebase-apply

# 3. Reset to clean state
git reset --hard HEAD

# 4. Sync with remote
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# 5. Verify clean
git status

# 6. Push if needed
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

#### 10.10.6 Auto-Generated Files Conflict Prevention

Files like `*.log`, `dev.log`, `*.db` often cause merge conflicts because they change automatically.

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
echo "dev.log" >> .gitignore
echo "*.db" >> .gitignore

# If already tracked, remove from git
git rm --cached *.log
git rm --cached dev.log

# Commit the fix
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: ignore auto-generated files"
git push origin main
```

**If conflict already happened on auto-generated file:**
```bash
# Accept your version (usually safe for logs)
git checkout --ours dev.log
git add dev.log
git commit -m "fix: resolve log file conflict"
git push origin main
```

#### 10.10.7 Stash Safety in Sandbox

`git stash` can create problems in sandbox:

| Stash Risk | Why | Prevention |
|------------|-----|------------|
| Stash with conflict | Apply fails | Never stash during conflict |
| Stash + session end | Stash lost | Push instead of stash |
| Stash pop on dirty tree | Unexpected merge | Clean tree before pop |

**Safe stash workflow:**
```bash
# Only stash clean changes
git status  # verify what will be stashed
git stash push -m "descriptive message"

# Immediately commit to preserve
git stash pop
git add -A
git commit -m "wip: stashed changes"
git push origin main
```

#### 10.10.8 Detached HEAD Recovery

Detached HEAD can occur after:
- Checking out a specific commit
- Checking out a tag
- Failed rebase continuation

**Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Identify current state
git branch -v
git log --oneline -5

# 2. If work needs saving
git checkout -b rescue-branch
git push origin rescue-branch

# 3. Return to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 4. Merge or reapply work
git merge rescue-branch
# OR manually reapply
```

#### 10.10.9 Git Hooks Interference

Git hooks in `.git/hooks/` can interfere with automated operations:

| Hook | Potential Issue | Solution |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| `pre-commit` | Blocks automated commits | Disable or make idempotent |
| `pre-push` | Blocks force push | Accept or modify hook |
| `commit-msg` | Rejects commit format | Follow format or disable |

**Bypass hooks when necessary:**
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
git push --no-verify origin main
```

**Warning:** Only bypass hooks when you understand the consequences.

#### 10.10.10 GPG Signing in Sandbox

GPG signing may block commits in sandbox if not configured:

```bash
# Check if GPG signing is enabled
git config commit.gpgsign

# If "true" and causing issues:
git config --global commit.gpgsign false

# Or configure GPG properly
git config --global gpg.program gpg2
git config --global user.signingkey <key-id>
```

#### 10.10.11 Comprehensive Pre-Operation Checklist

Run this before ANY complex git operation:

```bash
# === STATE CHECK ===
echo "=== Git State Check ==="
git status
ls .git/*.lock 2>/dev/null && echo "WARNING: Lock files exist"
ls .git/rebase-merge/ 2>/dev/null && echo "WARNING: Rebase in progress"
ls .git/MERGE_HEAD 2>/dev/null && echo "WARNING: Merge in progress"

# === REMOTE SYNC ===
echo "=== Remote Sync Check ==="
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# === WORKING TREE ===
echo "=== Working Tree ==="
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat

# === DECISION ===
echo "=== Safe to proceed? ==="
echo "If ANY warnings above: RESOLVE FIRST"
```

#### 10.10.12 Emergency Recovery Summary

| Situation | Immediate Action | Recovery Command |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Rebase deadlock | Session restart | `git rebase --abort` |
| Merge deadlock | Session restart | `git merge --abort` |
| Lock files | Remove locks | `rm -f .git/*.lock` |
| Remote ahead (solo) | Force push | `git push --force-with-lease origin main` |
| Detached HEAD | Create branch | `git checkout -b rescue && git push` |
| Auto-file conflict | Accept ours | `git checkout --ours <file>` |
| Hook blocking | Bypass hook | `git commit --no-verify` |

### 10.11 Post-Deadlock Clone Recovery

After a git deadlock, another agent might clone the repository **inside** the broken project instead of **replacing** it. This creates a nested structure that breaks everything.

#### 10.11.1 The Nested Project Trap

```
WRONG (nested project - NOTHING WORKS):
/home/z/my-project/                          ← old broken project (git deadlock)
  ├── .git/                                  ← BLOCKED rebase
  ├── src/
  ├── package.json
  └── Z.Code-Guide-Coding-Tool-Helper/       ← clone INSIDE old project!
       ├── .git/                             ← clean git
       ├── src/
       └── package.json

CORRECT (clean replacement):
/home/z/my-project/                          ← clean clone (replacement)
  ├── .git/                                  ← clean git
  ├── src/
  └── package.json
```

**Why nested projects fail:**
- Dev server won't find correct paths
- Port 3000 won't bind correctly
- Imports resolve to wrong node_modules
- Environment files not found
- Git operations affect wrong repository

#### 10.11.2 Correct Procedure After Deadlock

**Step 1: Verify if project is corrupted**

```bash
# Check for deadlock state
ls /home/z/my-project/.git/rebase-merge/ 2>/dev/null && echo "DEADLOCKED"
ls /home/z/my-project/.git/MERGE_HEAD 2>/dev/null && echo "DEADLOCKED"

# Check for nested project (WRONG structure)
ls -d /home/z/my-project/*/  # should show src/, not another project!
```

**Step 2: If corrupted, DELETE ENTIRE directory and re-clone**

```bash
# DELETE the entire corrupted project
rm -rf /home/z/my-project

# Clone DIRECTLY to the target path (NOT as subdirectory)
git clone https://<token>@github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git /home/z/my-project

# Verify correct structure
ls /home/z/my-project/
# Should show: src/, package.json, .git/ — NOT another project folder!

# Setup
cd /home/z/my-project
bun install
cp .env.example .env
bun run db:push  # if applicable
bun run dev
```

#### 10.11.3 The Critical Difference

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| `git clone <url>` (creates subdirectory) | `git clone <url> /home/z/my-project` |
| `cd /home/z/my-project && git clone <url>` | `rm -rf /home/z/my-project && git clone <url> /home/z/my-project` |

**Key insight:** Always specify the target directory explicitly when cloning after deadlock:

```bash
# WRONG - creates nested project
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Result: /home/z/my-project/repo/  ← WRONG!

# CORRECT - replaces old project
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git /home/z/my-project
# Result: /home/z/my-project/  ← CORRECT!
```

#### 10.11.4 Cleanup Checklist After Deadlock Recovery

```
[ ] Old directory completely removed (rm -rf)
[ ] Clone command specifies target path explicitly
[ ] No nested project structure exists
[ ] .git/ is at correct level (/home/z/my-project/.git/)
[ ] package.json is at correct level
[ ] bun install runs successfully
[ ] bun run dev starts on correct port
```
